//since the user's individual data is passed via a NavLink, if the user somehow reaches this page (ex: pasting url manually or via a bookmark) then the person's info would have never been fetched from People.js and sent when we tunnel through the NavLink to get here.
//This means we could check to see if the NavLink state is there, if not, we could fetch the user's data in here.
//The other option would be to just redirect the user back to the homepage. But that wouldn't be a good userExp. we should fetch.

//NEXT: place navigate() in there first, and then immediately after show them how to call state by using the location object we are already passing in. Also can do this with useParams()
//the main will still be the crappy version.
